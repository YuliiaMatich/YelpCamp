# Yelp Camp
A full stack Web Application - catalogue of campgrounds with an interactive map. 
As a logged in user you can leave a review for existing campgrounds or create your own campground. Campground creator can edit campground information(including campground name, price, location and photos) or delete campground.

Not logged in users can only view campgrounds.

The app was built with Mongo DB, Express, EJS. 
Additionally the following was used:
- Cloudinary (cloud-based images storage)
- Passport (authentication middleware for Node.js);
- Mapbox GL JS(interactive map);
- Bootstrap (including Responsive Web design).
